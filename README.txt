Owl City Synth
================================================

John Bowler, Erin Main

It's called the Owl City Synth because it sounds
a lot like Owl City for some reason.

Key mapping explanation:
Left hand (harmony)
- 1: I chord, 2: V chord, 3: vi chord, 4: IV chord
- This chord progression is the (in)famous "Four Chord Harmony"
  used in many pop songs. 
  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%E2%80%93V%E2%80%93vi%E2%80%93IV_progression)
- The idea is that the player plays the keys in order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 1
  to generate a decent sounding harmony.
  - One could play the variation of keys in order: 3, 4, 1, 2, 3 to get
    another popular harmony.

Right hand (melody)
- t: scale degree 1, y: deg 2, u: deg 3, i: deg 5, o: deg 6, p: deg 1
- This is the pentatonic scale (an octave up from the harmony), used
  because it sounds pleasing no matter what order you play the notes in
  and what chord you play under it.

Modifier keys
- space bar: changes timbre, cycles between ["sine", "square", "triangle", "sawtooth"]
- left/right keys: decrease/increase pitch by half steps
- up/down keys: increase/lower volume

Who did stuff:
- John created the NoteGenerator class and figured out how to play multiple notes at once. 
  He also did the conversion from pitch to frequency. Erin did the envelope generation, 
  harmonics addition, and made the synthesizer part. (He did the first half and Erin did
  the second half.)

- Special credit to Erin's friend Alwina who was the performer in the video. (There are some
  minor tweaks between the final version and the version she used, but no major differences.)
